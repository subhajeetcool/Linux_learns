# Linux_learns
Learning of Linux for the Devops role based.
# Day 1:
# Operating System:
Linux is opensource and it is super secure compared to other O/S.
O/S: It is an intermediate s/w layer that acts as a bridge between s/w and h/w and it performs process, device, memeory, disk, network management.
For windows o/s it provides GUI and for Linux o/s it provides CLI.

# Components of Linux:
1. User application ( VIM, Docker, Apache, etc )
2. Shell ( Bash, etc )
3. System Libraries ( Lib, OpenSSL, etc ) 
4. System Utilities ( ls, grep, systemctl, etc )
5. Kernel ( process, device, memeory, disk, network, etc )
6. Hardware ( CPU, ram, disk, network, etc )

**Linux Kernel:** Interacts with the hardare such process, device, memeory, disk, network management handled by Linux kernel.
On top of the kernel it has system layers and on top of it have CLI.
Have used WSL as well as Docker containers to simulate the Linux environment in my PC.
Package managers:
It helps to deploy, upgrade, delete, maintain and install the dependencies.
For ubuntu the package is - apt
**HOSTINGER**
It provides diffenrt types of O/S with have annual plans for practice Linux.
**Must know Linux Commands for productions:**
1. cd then enter - returns back to home folder
2. ls - lists the files and folders
3. rm filename - to delete the filename
4. rm -r directorname - to delete the directory
5. pwd - which the present working directory
6. When we are working on Linux we should be aware on which shell we working for? to check - echo $SHELL - which will show the /bin/bash
7. mkdir sunha - to create a directory
8. mkdir -p subha/new/{folder1,folder2} - to create folders inside the folders with multiple folders
